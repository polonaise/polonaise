Polonaise is a file system protocol.

Polonaise uses Thrift (https://thrift.apache.org/) in its transport layer. If
you want to get Thrift, have a look at utils/compile-thrift.sh

Polonaise can be build with CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).

The protocol is described in src/protocol/polonaise/polonaise.thrift
